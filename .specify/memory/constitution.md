# Claude Code Handbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Markdown-First
All content MUST be in markdown format. Documentation MUST be self-contained
and clearly structured with proper headings and code blocks.

**Rationale**: Ensures portability, version control compatibility, and universal
tool support.

### II. Docusaurus-Compatible
Content MUST follow Docusaurus conventions: front matter for metadata, proper
directory structure, and standard navigation patterns.

**Rationale**: Enables static site generation with built-in search, versioning,
and responsive design.

### III. Clarity & Accuracy
Content MUST be clear and accurate. Outdated content MUST be updated or removed.

**Rationale**: Accurate, clear documentation is more valuable than comprehensive
but confusing documentation.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Version increments follow semantic versioning:
- MAJOR: Incompatible principle changes
- MINOR: New principles added
- PATCH: Clarifications and fixes

### Compliance
All contributions MUST align with these principles. Deviations MUST be justified
or rejected.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-04 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-04
