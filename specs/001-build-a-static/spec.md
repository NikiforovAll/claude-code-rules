# Feature Specification: Docusaurus Static Website with GitHub Pages

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-static`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build a static web site deployed as github static pages using docusaurus; it should be filled with content based on exsting documents @BEST-PRACTICES.md and @TIPS-AND-TRICKS.md; the documents should be refactored into digestable pages; right now no need to add details to each section; keep as is; but introduces different pages for topic in documents"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Description parsed: Create Docusaurus site with GitHub Pages deployment
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✅ Identified: static site generation, content migration, page restructuring, deployment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No major ambiguities - feature is well-defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ User flows defined for readers and maintainers
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ Requirements generated and testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✅ Entities: Documentation Pages, Navigation Structure, Static Assets
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   → ✅ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer learning Claude Code best practices, I want to browse well-organized documentation on a clean, searchable website so that I can quickly find relevant tips, tricks, and patterns without reading through long markdown files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I visit the deployed website, **When** I land on the homepage, **Then** I see a clear introduction and navigation to main topics (Best Practices, Tips & Tricks)
2. **Given** I'm on the website, **When** I click on a topic in the sidebar, **Then** I navigate to a focused page covering that specific topic
3. **Given** I'm reading about "Planning & Problem Solving", **When** I look at the navigation, **Then** I see it organized into sub-topics (TDD, Spec-Driven, Brainstorming, etc.) as separate pages
4. **Given** I'm browsing on mobile, **When** I access any page, **Then** the content is readable and navigation is accessible
5. **Given** the content is updated in the repository, **When** changes are pushed to the main branch, **Then** the website automatically rebuilds and deploys
6. **Given** I'm looking for specific information, **When** I use the search feature, **Then** I find relevant pages across the restructured content
7. **Given** I prefer dark mode, **When** I toggle the theme, **Then** the site switches between light and dark themes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when someone accesses an old URL after restructuring? (Need redirect or helpful 404)
- How does search handle content that's been split across multiple pages?
- What happens if GitHub Pages deployment fails? (Build status visibility)
- How are internal links between BEST-PRACTICES.md and TIPS-AND-TRICKS.md preserved?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Website MUST present all content from BEST-PRACTICES.md split into separate pages by major section
- **FR-002**: Website MUST present all content from TIPS-AND-TRICKS.md split into separate pages by major section
- **FR-003**: Website MUST provide hierarchical sidebar navigation reflecting the document structure (sections and subsections)
- **FR-004**: Website MUST include a homepage with introduction and links to main documentation sections
- **FR-005**: Website MUST support full-text search across all pages
- **FR-006**: Website MUST be responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **FR-007**: Website MUST automatically deploy to GitHub Pages on commits to main branch
- **FR-008**: Website MUST preserve all existing content without information loss during page restructuring
- **FR-009**: Website MUST maintain all code examples, links, and formatting from source documents
- **FR-010**: Website MUST load pages within 3 seconds on standard connections
- **FR-011**: Each page MUST have breadcrumb navigation showing its location in the hierarchy
- **FR-012**: Website MUST support dark mode and light mode theme switching
- **FR-013**: Website MUST convert internal markdown references to proper page links
- **FR-014**: Website MUST maintain consistent styling across all pages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Page**: Individual page representing a topic with title, content, navigation metadata, and breadcrumb information
- **Navigation Structure**: Hierarchical sidebar configuration mapping topics to pages and defining parent-child relationships
- **Content Section**: Logical grouping of related pages (e.g., "Best Practices" → "Planning & Problem Solving" → "TDD")
- **Static Assets**: Images, diagrams, icons, and other media referenced by documentation pages
