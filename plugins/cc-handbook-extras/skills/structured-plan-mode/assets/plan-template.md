## Phase 0: Research & Strategy Selection
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **Planned**
**Priority**: Critical (Must complete before any implementation tasks)

### Goal
[Describe the research objective - understand existing patterns, identify approaches, evaluate alternatives]

### Context
[Explain why this research is needed and what questions need answering]

**Action Items**:

- [ ] Review existing patterns in codebase
- [ ] Analyze relevant APIs/data sources
- [ ] Identify 2-4 viable approach options
- [ ] Present findings and trade-offs to user
- [ ] Get user confirmation on selected approach

### Strategy Proposals

> **Fill this during research as you discover options**

**Option A: [Approach Name]**
- Description: [Brief description]
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Drawbacks]

**Option B: [Approach Name]**
- Description: [Brief description]
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Drawbacks]

**Option C: [Approach Name]** (if applicable)
- Description: [Brief description]
- Pros: [Benefits]
- Cons: [Drawbacks]

### Selected Approach
