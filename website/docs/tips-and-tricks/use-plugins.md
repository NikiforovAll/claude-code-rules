# Use Plugins

Claude Code plugins are custom collections of extension points that can be installed with a single command. They allow you to bundle and share development workflows, tools, and best practices.

## What are Plugins?

Plugins can include four main types of customizations:

1. **Slash commands** - Custom shortcuts for frequently-used operations
2. **Subagents** - Purpose-built agents for specialized development tasks
3. **MCP servers** - Connections to tools and data sources through the Model Context Protocol
4. **Hooks** - Customizations to Claude Code's behavior at key workflow points

## Installing Plugins

Use the `/plugin` command to install a plugin:

```
/plugin install <plugin-name-or-url>
```

Plugins can be toggled on and off as needed, helping reduce system prompt complexity when not in use.

## Benefits

- **Share development setups** - Distribute your workflows across projects
- **Standardize team practices** - Ensure consistent approaches across your team
- **Quick tool integration** - Connect tools and data sources easily
- **Enforce standards** - Maintain engineering best practices automatically
- **Bundle customizations** - Group related configurations together

The Claude Code team maintains official plugin examples that you can learn from or use directly:
