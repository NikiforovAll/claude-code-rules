# Open Prompt in Default Editor

When you need to write longer or more complex prompts, you can press `Ctrl+G` to open your system's configured text editor.

## Usage

1. Press `Ctrl+G` at the Claude Code prompt
2. Your system's default text editor will open
3. Write or edit your prompt in the editor
4. Save and close the editor
5. The prompt will be submitted to Claude Code

## Benefits

- Write multi-line prompts more comfortably
- Use your preferred editor's features (syntax highlighting, spell check, etc.)
- Edit longer instructions without dealing with terminal line editing limitations
- Paste and format complex code snippets or requirements

:::tip Plan Mode Prompts
You can also use `Ctrl+G` when responding to plan mode prompts! This is especially useful for refining complex implementation plans or adding detailed requirements before Claude starts coding.

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have a text editor configured in your system's `EDITOR` or `VISUAL` environment variable for the best experience.
