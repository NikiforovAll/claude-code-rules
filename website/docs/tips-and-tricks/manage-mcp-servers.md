# Manage MCP Servers

You can quickly enable or disable MCP servers using the `@` mention feature or through the `/mcp` command.

## Quick Toggle with @mention

Simply type `@` followed by the server name in your prompt to toggle an MCP server on or off:

```
@playwright
```

This will enable or disable the Playwright MCP server for your current session.

## Using the /mcp Command

Alternatively, you can use the `/mcp` command to manage MCP servers:

```
/mcp
```

This opens the MCP management interface where you can view and toggle all configured servers.

> ğŸ’¡ This is useful when you want to reduce context usage by disabling MCP servers you're not currently using, or when you need to quickly enable a specific server for a task.
