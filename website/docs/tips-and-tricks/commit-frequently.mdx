# Commit frequently

Git commits are free, so commit often and use meaningful commit messages. This helps you track changes and makes it easier to revert if needed.

Use the [`/commit`](/component-reference/commands/commit) command to automate commit creation with conventional commit messages and emojis.

## Command Specification

<CodeBlock language="markdown">
{CommitCommandSource}
</CodeBlock>
