# Use `@tasks-agent` agent

<span className="badge badge--handbook-agent-spec-kit">handbook-agent-spec-kit</span>

Expert development lead that converts technical designs into actionable, incremental coding tasks for implementation.

The `@tasks-agent` breaks down designs into discrete, manageable coding tasks (1-4 hours each) organized by phases. It creates a step-by-step implementation guide with progress tracking, requirements traceability, and test integration.

## When to Use

Use the `@tasks-agent` when you want to:

- Convert technical design into specific coding tasks
- Create incremental implementation plan
- Track progress through task completion
- Ensure requirements traceability
- Plan testing throughout implementation

**Prerequisites**: Approved requirements.md and design.md must exist

## Key Features

- **Incremental Tasks**: 1-4 hour coding tasks that build on each other
- **Progress Tracking**: Summary with completion percentage
- **Requirements Traceability**: Every task references specific requirements
- **Test Integration**: Testing included throughout implementation
- **Coding Only**: Excludes manual testing, deployment, non-coding activities
- **Three Sections**: Progress Summary, Completed Tasks, Pending Tasks

## Usage Examples

**Basic usage:**
```
@tasks-agent create implementation plan for user authentication
```

**With design reference:**
```
@tasks-agent break down specs/auth-feature/design.md into tasks
```

## Output Structure

Creates `specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md` with:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Progress Summary
- Total Tasks: 5
- Completed: 0
- Remaining: 5
- Progress: 0%

## Completed Tasks ✓

_No tasks completed yet._

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] 1. Create project structure
  - Initialize files and directories
  - Files: src/index.ts, package.json
  - Requirements: 1.1

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] 2. Implement authentication service
  [Detailed sub-items...]
  - Requirements: 2.1, 2.3
```

## Task Sequencing Strategy

- **Phase 1: Foundation** - Structure, interfaces, basic models
- **Phase 2: Core Implementation** - Business logic with unit tests
- **Phase 3: Integration** - Component wiring, API layer, integration tests
- **Phase 4: Validation & Completion** - Error handling, E2E tests, cleanup

## Quality Standards

- Maximum 2 levels of nesting (no 1.1.1 or deeper)
- Each task 1-4 hours to complete
- Only coding activities included
- Requirements properly referenced
- Testing integrated throughout
- Tasks organized by logical phases
