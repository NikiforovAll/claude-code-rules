# Use `git-worktree` skill

<span className="badge badge--secondary">handbook-extras</span>

Comprehensive Git worktree management for parallel development across multiple branches without stashing changes.

The `git-worktree` skill enables you to create, list, delete, and switch between Git worktrees using a sibling directory pattern. Worktrees eliminate context-switching friction by allowing simultaneous work on different branches in isolated directories, perfect for handling quick bug fixes during feature development or conducting code reviews without interrupting your current work.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the `git-worktree` skill when you want to:

- Work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing changes
- Create isolated environments for parallel development tasks
- Quickly switch contexts between feature work and urgent bug fixes
- Set up dedicated worktrees for code reviews or testing
- Manage complex multi-branch workflows efficiently

## Skill Specification

## Key Features

### Sibling Directory Pattern

Worktrees are created outside the main repository using the pattern `../<project>-<branch>`:
- Main repo: `~/dev/myproject`
- Worktree: `~/dev/myproject-feature-x`
- Benefits: Clean separation, no nested repos, IDE-friendly structure

### Hybrid Interface

The skill adapts to your workflow:
- **Interactive mode**: Use menu-driven prompts when invoked without arguments
- **Direct mode**: Provide commands and arguments for quick operations

### Comprehensive Operations

- **List**: View all active worktrees with commit details
- **Create from remote**: Fetch and create worktree from remote branch
- **Create from local**: Create worktree from existing local branch
- **Create new branch**: Create worktree with a brand new branch
- **Delete**: Remove worktrees and clean up metadata
- **Switch helper**: Get navigation commands for easy worktree switching

## Example Workflows

### Quick Bug Fix During Feature Work

```
User: "Create worktree from remote branch hotfix-login"
```

Claude creates a worktree at `../myproject-hotfix-login`, allowing you to fix the bug while keeping your feature work intact in the main repository.

### Parallel Development

```
User: "List all worktrees"
```

See all active worktrees with their branches and commits, then navigate between them without losing context.

### Code Review Setup

```
User: "Create worktree from remote branch feature-authentication"
```

Review a colleague's branch in isolation while your own work remains untouched.
