# Use `dotnet-dependency` skill

<span className="badge badge--handbook-dotnet">handbook-dotnet</span>

Investigate and manage .NET project dependencies using built-in dotnet CLI commands.

This skill helps you understand why packages are included, list all project dependencies, find outdated or vulnerable packages, and trace transitive dependencies.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the `dotnet-dependency` skill when you want to:

- Understand why a specific NuGet package is included (`dotnet nuget why`)
- List all project dependencies (NuGet packages or project references)
- Find outdated or vulnerable packages
- Trace transitive dependencies

## Quick Examples

```bash
# Why is this package included?
dotnet nuget why Newtonsoft.Json

# List NuGet packages
dotnet list package

# Include transitive dependencies
dotnet list package --include-transitive

# List project references
dotnet list reference --project path/to/Project.csproj

# Find outdated packages
dotnet list package --outdated

# Auto-update with dotnet-outdated (third-party)
dotnet outdated -u
```
