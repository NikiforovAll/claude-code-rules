# Use `/reflect`

<span className="badge badge--handbook-extras">handbook-extras</span>

Create reflective analyses of your Claude Code sessions to improve your development workflow and capture lessons learned.

The `/reflect` command helps you step back and analyze the **meta aspects** of your work session - not what you built, but how you built it. It generates a structured markdown reflection covering techniques used, what worked well, lessons learned, and actionable improvements for future sessions.

## When to Use

Use `/reflect` to:

- **After completing a significant task**: Capture insights while they're fresh
- **When encountering repeated challenges**: Document patterns to avoid in the future
- **For team knowledge sharing**: Create reusable workflow improvements
- **During skill development**: Track your growth in using Claude Code effectively

## Command Specification

<CodeBlock language="markdown">
{ReflectCommandSource}
</CodeBlock>

## Output

The command creates a markdown file at `.claude/reflections/<date>-<name>.md` with structured sections including:

- **What Went Well**: Effective techniques and approaches
- **What Went Wrong**: Areas for improvement
- **Lessons Learned**: Key insights from the session
- **Action Items**: Specific improvements to apply next time
- **Tips & Tricks**: Claude Code patterns discovered
- **Generalization Opportunities**: Potential for reusable components

## Benefits

- **Continuous improvement**: Build better workflows over time
- **Team learning**: Share effective patterns across your team
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify what works and what doesn't
- **Skill development**: Accelerate mastery of Claude Code
- **Documentation**: Create a searchable knowledge base of sessions

## Example Usage

After debugging a complex API integration:

```
/reflect
```

This might generate: `.claude/reflections/2025-01-25-api-debugging.md` documenting your problem-solving approach, tool usage patterns, and lessons learned about API troubleshooting with Claude Code.
